// Videsh is developing a program that calculates the distance between two points in a two-dimensional
// coordinate system. The program asks the user to enter the x and y coordinates of two points (pi and p2).
// It then calculates the Euclidean distance between these two points using a function in the class. Finally, it
// displays the calculated distance between two points. Use 'this' pointer to solve the problem.
// Euclidean distance formula: d = / [(Ã—2 - x1)2 + (y2 - 12]
// Note: This is a sample question asked in an HCL interview.
// Input format :
// The first line of input consists of two floating-point numbers representing the x and y coordinates of the first
// point.
// The second line of input contains two floating-point numbers representing the x and y coordinates of the second
// point.
// Output format :
// The output displays the distance between the two points, rounded off to two decimal places.
// Code constraints :
// 0.00 <= x, y <= 500.00

// You are using GCC
#include<iostream>
#include<cmath>
