// You are given a set of arrays, and you need to write a program to merge them into a single array
// in the order they are given. The goal is to create a new array that contains all the elements from
// the input arrays, maintaining the order of the elements as per the given order.
// Input format :
// The input will be provided as follows:
// The first line contains an integer, numArrays, which represents the number of arrays to merge.
// For each array, the following lines will provide the details:
// The first line contains an integer, arraySize, which represents the size of the array.
// The second line contains arraySize space-separated integers, representing the elements of the
// array.
// Output format :
// The output displays a single line containing the merged array.

// Refer to the sample output for formatting specifications.
// Code constraints:
// 1s numArrays < 10: The number of arrays to merge.
// 1s arraySize < 100: The size of each array
// -106 â‰¤ elements of the arrays < 106. The elements of the arrays can be integers within this range.

// You are using GCC
