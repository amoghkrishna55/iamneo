// Imagine you are developing a digital diary application that allows users to record important moments and
// events with timestamps. As part of this application, you need to create a program that fetches the hours,
// minutes, days, months, and years from the user and stores them in a class member function. The program
// should then display the date, time, and minutes from another member function in the class.
// Your task is to write a program that prompts the user to enter the hours, minutes, days, months, and years.
// Implement a class that includes a member function to initialize these values and another member function to
// display the formatted date, time, and minutes. This program will enable users to keep track of their important
// moments with accurate timestamps in an organized manner within the digital diary application.

// Note: This is a sample question asked in a Capgemini interview.
// Input format :
// The input consists of hours, minutes, days, months, and years in the same order separated by a space.
// Output format :
// The output displays the date, time, and total minutes as shown in the sample outputs.
// If the outputs are not valid, the output displays "Invalid".
// Code constraints:
// O < Date <= 31
// 0 < Month <= 12
// 0 < Year < 9999
// 0 < hours < 24
// 0 â€¹ minutes < 60

// You are using GCC
